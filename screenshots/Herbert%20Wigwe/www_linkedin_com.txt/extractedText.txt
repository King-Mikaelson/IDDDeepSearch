    World Economic Governance report flags Nigeria as a “do not invest in” country because of "poor governance that can cost investors billions and expose investors to legal and political troubles" - a clear signal to the federal government unless they are marketing Nigeria to entities with questionable corporate culture and reputation. 

Achieving real and digital infrastructure that enables Nigeria to accompany Africa to the promised land of the digital economy requires a credible electoral process, political will, cost-saving sensibilities, accountability, and open governance. 

We shared our views on how a well-implemented National Data Strategy and the National Population Commission's eCVRS enhance Nigeria's #fintech services, #financial #inclusion, and #fintechs #valuation. Please use the link below if you want to read the commentary: https://lnkd.in/dEAq93iG

    Nigeria's 2024 budget is over 2,000 pages. Our #education  #budget2024  report is a snapshot of where the spending is. We hope that Tertiary Education Trust Fund Tetfund will partner with Nigerian or African Universities and stop piling pressures on Naira when it sends lecturers to Western Universities for further studies. Private Universities must urgently and intentionally build capacity to absorb training demands from public universities. Many thanks to my colleagues at SRJ #educationlaw #SRJLegal

    #education Herbert Wigwe, C.F.R was his final show of love for human capital development and enterprise. Although we are deeply saddened, - his family suffers most - we are consoled by his fruitful hard work. He is exemplary in foresight. May they rest the much desired Rest.

    There's a pervading consensus that Nigeria's educational sector is on downhill auto drive.

 Education lawyers and the support team at SRJ  reviewed Nigeria's 2024 education budget. In my view, quality assurance and process improvement was not prioritized.

 Given the magnitude of lost times, perhaps, Nigeria needs an agency dedicated to quality assurance - instead of the Armed Forces scattered quality assurance offices across Cantonments. 

A professor mentioned to me that he dispatched 14 exam scripts to his 3 other colleagues on the same course and 15 scripts returned to him, despite the forwarding note that read 14 scripts. 

He silently fished out the intruding script through the attendance script.

    Our Education Lawyers and our esteemed support staff have produced a report on Nigeria's 2024 Education Budget across Ministries, Departments and Agencies including educational institutions. This maiden report shows a notable percentage dedicated to federal universities, quality assurance infrastructure, Capital and recurrent expenditures in Nigeria's fledgling educational sector. We highlighted TETFunds' approved 2024 expenditure. However, will  the distribution of educational funds among the MDAs effectively readdress Nigeria's education challenges? Our Education Law team are committed to supporting schools, regulators, and parents on their journey.

    Dammy, a highly mobile corporate banker who resigned his employment in 2022 lost the national assembly election. 

Today, he's a politically exposed person (PEP). Likewise, Asawaju who was the successful gubernatorial candidate's campaign manager. 

PEPs undergo enhanced due diligence (EDD) in the financial and non-financial designated businesses and professionals that include law firms and lawyers. 

A lawyer must apply an EDD if a client's KYC flags PEP status, including verifying the source of funds. 

The NBA AML framework did not include EDD but it is an obligation under the AML Act 2022.

    My first contact with FGM (femal genital mutilation) was during Prof. Joy Ezeillo's (SAN) Children and Women's rights class at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. #fgm is despicable and violates the Girl-child. #fgm is not the opposite of circumcision - which is positive and dignifying whether adminsiter to male children or more painfully to boys.

    Female Genital mutilation is against the dignity of the human person, the integrity of a woman and the respect that the Girl-child deserves and desires.

    I am glad you are attentive to this. These informal toll gates are everywhere. It chokes all the sectors, and consumers pay. Sir, your agile team should study how these informal tolls psychologically affect us. Drive through Mushin by Agege Motorway, Ikeja Underbridge, Ojuelgba Road, Marine, Broad Street by UBA house, and many others after 4:45 p.m. and you will notice "official" trading on the sidewalk and lanes.  Those traders pay rent (tolls) or the bus drivers that occupy junctions while LASTMA looks the other side. The LASTMA task force parked on a walkway at Ikeja underbridge by General Hospital. Tolls on fuel bought in a container at a gas station. Taiwo Oyedele, you enjoy our collective trust and best wishes, but your work is massive. Informal tolls thrive on interest-based law enforcement.

    *Streamlining multiple taxes in the informal sector and tackling unorthodox methods of collection*

Engaging the public in fiscal policy reforms is crucial, so we seize every opportunity to share our plans, and our thought process, provide clarifications and address areas of concern, all in the public interest.

Currently, we have over 60 taxes, levies and charges across the 3 levels of government with state and local governments administering 46 taxes and levies, including road taxes, motor park levies, truck, canoe, wheelbarrow and cart fees etc. There are even more unauthorised taxes all disproportionately affecting small businesses including petty traders, hawkers, artisans, truckers, cart pushers, okada riders and other transporters. 

The associated costs are inevitably passed on to consumers, mostly low income earners. The payers also have to contend with the unorthodox means of collection and harassment from untrained “revenue collectors” on highways, markets, streets etc while there is very little to show for the revenues collected.

Our proposal is to repeal many of these burdensome taxes, harmonise the few that are justifiable, and digitise the collection process with multiple channels including USSD to drive efficiency, reduce leakages and promote accountability.

We recognise that these reforms also have a social dimension. We have a choice to recommend that new personnel be recruited and trained to drive compliance or we can train the existing collectors to be civil in their approach. While the former may lead to potential backlash, the latter offers a more sustainable solution, avoiding social crises and providing relief to small businesses. Our reforms stand a better chance of success when we find a win-win outcome for all stakeholders than those which seek to alienate others.

We welcome criticisms and always cherish the opportunity to engage. We are open to and actively seek feedback and ideas from the public. Please share your thoughts, feedback and ideas with us including alternative perspectives to refine our approach.
